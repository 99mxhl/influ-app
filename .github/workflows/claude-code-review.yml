            Review pull request #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            Use `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see the changes, then read any files you need for context.

            Tech stack: Spring Boot 3.x (Java 21), PostgreSQL, Flutter 3.x with Riverpod.

            First, check previous reviews using `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json reviews` to see if there were prior requested changes.

            Check for bugs, security issues (OWASP top 10), code style (Google style for Java, Effective Dart for Flutter), and architecture concerns.

            When done, post a review using `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`:
            - If no issues found: approve with `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "LGTM"`
            - If issues found: request changes with detailed findings

            IMPORTANT: Do not use "#1", "#2" style references for issue numbering - use "Issue A", "Issue B" or descriptive names instead to avoid confusion with PR numbers.
            IMPORTANT: Only review PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}, do not review other PRs.
